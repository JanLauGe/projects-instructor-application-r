This project assumes you can manipulate data frames using `dplyr` as taught in the course [Introduction to the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse). We will also use a number of other `tidyverse` packages such as `tidyr` and `purrr`. Some familiarity with the fundamentals of machine learning is advisable, you can build it with [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-machine-learning-with-r).\n",
